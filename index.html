                    <h1>Get to Know Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hello everyone! I am a future web developer and currently a student of the craft. 
                        I was born and raised in the rural parts of Cuba, so it's safe to say I often
                        miss the outdoors and the farm life. Currently, I live in Miami, Florida, and I'm incredibly grateful to be near the ocean! 
                        I love to busy myself out in the water with a paddle board early mornings or at the 
                        mechanical wake park - practicing new wakeboarding tricks. Often, you'll find me teaching myself foreign languages. 
                        The world fascinates me, and I want to communicate with as many people from different cultures as I possibly can. 
                        
                
                        
                        I still don't know which programming languages are my favorite, but the most interesting spoken languages to me 
                        (aside my native tongue - Spanish) are Norwegian, German, and French. 
                        As I mentioned, I'm completely new to (and excited about) the tech world. 
                        This field interests me because it's an incredible platform to create connection with people and express my creativity. 
                        Plus, I'm ready to welcome programming languages into my life as well. 
                        Wish me luck, and let's have fun! 
                        <br>
                        Ha det bra!
                    </p>
                        
            
                        
            
                </div>
